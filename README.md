# Stock Price ETL and Forecasting with Airflow and Snowflake

## Overview

This project is designed to extract stock price data from the Alpha Vantage API, transform the data into a format suitable for analysis, and load it into Snowflake for further processing. It utilizes Apache Airflow to orchestrate the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline, and Snowflake's machine learning capabilities to train models and generate stock price predictions.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Fetches daily stock prices for specified symbols over the last 90 days from the Alpha Vantage API.
- **Data Transformation**: Prepares the raw data for loading into Snowflake, including cleaning and formatting.
- **Data Loading**: Loads the transformed data into a Snowflake database for storage and analysis.
- **Model Training**: Creates and trains machine learning models for stock price prediction using Snowflake's built-in functionalities.
- **Forecasting**: Generates future stock price predictions and stores the results for further analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Apache Airflow**: For orchestrating the ETL process.
- **Snowflake**: For data storage, processing, and machine learning.
- **Alpha Vantage API**: For fetching stock price data.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the implementation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Apache Airflow**: Ensure you have Apache Airflow installed and configured in your environment. 
2. **Snowflake Account**: You need access to a Snowflake account and have the necessary privileges to create databases and schemas.
3. **Alpha Vantage API Key**: Obtain an API key from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) and store it in Airflow's Variables as `vantage_api_key`.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-forecasting.git
   cd stock-price-forecasting
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install requests snowflake-connector-python apache-airflow
   ```

3. Configure your Airflow connection for Snowflake:
   - Go to the Airflow UI.
   - Navigate to **Admin** > **Connections**.
   - Add a new connection with the following parameters:
     - **Conn Id**: `snowflake_conn`
     - **Conn Type**: `Snowflake`
     - Fill in your Snowflake account information (user, password, account, etc.).

### DAG Configuration

- The DAG is defined in the main Python script, where tasks for data extraction, transformation, loading, model training, and forecasting are specified.
- The DAG runs daily at 2:40 AM (UTC). You can adjust the `schedule_interval` in the DAG definition as needed.

## Usage

1. **Start the Airflow Scheduler**:

   ```bash
   airflow scheduler
   ```

2. **Start the Airflow Web Server**:

   ```bash
   airflow webserver
   ```

3. Access the Airflow UI at `http://localhost:8080` and trigger the `two_stocks_DAG` to run the ETL process.

## Task Breakdown

- **extract_stock_data**: Extracts the last 90 days of stock prices for predefined symbols (`LMT`, `MCD`) from Alpha Vantage.
- **transform_stock_data**: Transforms the raw stock data into a structured format for loading into Snowflake.
- **load_to_snowflake**: Loads the transformed stock data into Snowflake.
- **train_stock_model**: Trains a machine learning model for a specified stock symbol.
- **predict_stock**: Generates future price predictions for a specified stock symbol.

## Notes

- Make sure to monitor the Airflow UI for task statuses and logs.
- Ensure you handle API call limits imposed by Alpha Vantage; consider implementing error handling for API request failures.
